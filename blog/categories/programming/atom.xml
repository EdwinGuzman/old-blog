    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My last personal blog post was written on March 7th, 2015. Over a year ago. I made an attempt to write more but that didn&rsquo;t happen, at least not for my personal blog.</p>

<p>That blog post mentioned how I had written one blog post, how I was in the middle of writing two more,  and how I was not too happy then.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a year and so much has changed. I have written <a href="http://www.nypl.org/blog/author/1269">seven blog posts</a> for nypl.org, two on running and five on coding; I have grown as a runner in 2015 and in the past three months of 2016; I ran the LA Marathon in February; I went to San Francisco last week to attend O'Reilly Fluent Conference; I just went on a date with my mom to see On Your Feet!; I have met so many other runners who motivate me; I&rsquo;ve helped my dad get on a running agenda and will race his first half marathon at the NYRR NYC Half and possibly run the Queens Marathon; and I am happy.</p>

<p>More biking, running, and coding.</p>
