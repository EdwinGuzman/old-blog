    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another race, another personal best record broken. To be fair, I don&rsquo;t race too many 10Ks and the last one before the Scotland Run was in July of 2015. With all the training I&rsquo;ve done and my performances at the Washington Heights 5K and NYC Half, I expected good results. Of course, anything can happen during a race and this was race was no exception.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.nyrr.org/races-and-events/2016/scotland-run-10k">NYRR Scotland Run 10K</a> was the second club points race of the year and both our men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s competitive teams were already off to a great start. After the first club points race the men&rsquo;s team placed 8th in the A division, the women&rsquo;s team placed 4th in the B division, and both teams were hungry for more.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I get excited for every race, but club points races make even more adrenaline run through you than usual races. The most important part of these races is the team. It&rsquo;s great to know that when you&rsquo;re racing, you&rsquo;re not just racing for yourself but for your team. That&rsquo;s not to say that there&rsquo;s added pressure to perform well&ndash;we always help and support each other to run our best. That&rsquo;s what helps strengthen our bonds and boost our team to another level.</p>

<h3>Scotland Run</h3>

<p>I met a few new runners in our team, said hi to Kevin and Jose who were working during the race, freaked out when I couldn&rsquo;t find the sticker to put on my bag, chilled when Maria tells me that it&rsquo;s a tag and not a sticker to add to the bag, and then started my warm up. For this race, I experimented with a slightly longer warm up that included very quick strides and some slower strides for a longer duration.</p>

<p>Kevin gave me a race strategy, but after a 5:51 first mile which felt surprisingly easy, I decided to maintain that pace instead of going a few seconds slower. My 5K split goal was 18:30 but I managed an 18:16 split. Everything was going well and I expected a slow 4th mile, but I was not expecting to slightly cramp up and not be able to breathe. After a few deep breaths I was back at it, running alongside another runner who kept me right on pace. Actually, I did not know how fast I was going for the last 2.2 miles but I knew I had to keep on attacking. Right around 5.70 miles into the race I began my kick, knowing there would only be about half a mile left. About 200m to go and I see Chaz running in the opposite direction cheering me on and I start my final kick. Final time of 36:34 and tied for third with Nate for Queens Distance.</p>

<h3>Youth Race</h3>

<p>Quickly after picking up my baggage, I run down to 59th and 5th Ave. to pick up my brother for his youth race. I was a bit worried about him coming to Central Park all by himself but it turned out that my sister accompanied him. It was very sweet of her, especially because she worked a night shift at her job. It&rsquo;s around 9:30am, we get some coffee and head to the start. After a quick pep talk, he was off running a 12:50 1.7 mile race. It&rsquo;s his first of a couple of races this year and I&rsquo;m really excited to see how he does at the Queens 10K!</p>
