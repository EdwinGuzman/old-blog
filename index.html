  <div class="entry-content"><p>It‚Äôs been close to two weeks after the NYC marathon and I still don&rsquo;t know how to put everything that has happened into words. The feelings of pride, happiness, sadness, determination, and emptiness still lingers. The love outweighs the negativity but I can&rsquo;t help and feel slightly upset about how this training cycle concluded. Lots of factors went into the back-to-back Chicago and NYC marathon races and I can only learn from the experience.</p>

<h2>The Bad</h2>

<p>Quick statistics: In 2015 I ran the NYC Marathon in 2:59:24 and then two weeks later the NYRR 60K in 4:37:41. This year, I ran the Chicago Marathon in 2:58:05 (a PR) and then the NYC Marathon in 3:00:55.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not sure how I did what I did last year, considering I feel fitter and stronger this year. A week before the NYC Marathon, however, I felt an intense pain in my right inner thigh, very close to the groin. I then took a few days off to rest well which halted my training, but I was suppose to rest and taper anyways. I was four miles into the NYC Marathon when I felt a slight pull and feelings of pain again. It was then that I knew that I had to slow down because it would be a tough marathon.</p>

<p>But, injury aside, I didn‚Äôt feel prepared for NYC. I don‚Äôt believe I lost any fitness from the Chicago Marathon which was about 4 weeks prior to NYC. Now that I had time to think about it, I was disappointed about how the Chicago Marathon unfolded and I was afraid of repeating the same situation in NYC. Luckily, because I went through it just recently, I felt better about failing this time around.</p>

<h2>The Good</h2>

<p>I had two Boston Qualifying races about one month apart, I ran with a bigger Queens Distance team, I saw many friends and family along the course, and I was able to share this marathon experience with my father who ran his first NYC Marathon. All of that made this NYC Marathon my favorite marathon yet. It was an incredible feeling to go through all of that in a span of a few hours, a fraction of which was the actual race.</p>

<h1>TCS NYC Marathon</h1>

<p>My team set up another bus shuttle ride to Staten Island this year and it was a sleepy joy to meetup with teammates and other runners all going to run NYC, either again or for the first time. Being surrounded by first timers made the trip uneasy because I caught their nervousness but later regained control. After unloading, some of us headed to the Local Competitor area which now had so many Queens Distance runners. My father was with me this entire time and he was in awe about everything, especially since I kept telling him about everything that was around us. That truly made the experience amazing; how many can say they started off the NYC Marathon with their father?</p>

<p>The race started off well though it might‚Äôve been faster that what I wanted to start off at. As I mentioned above, the slight pain at mile 4 made me settle into a steadier pace. Everything was going well and I was really enjoying the crowd. I pinned a small Mexican flag on my chest and I kept hearing ‚Äúvamos Mexico!‚Äù which really filled me up with pride. (Note: I should really try adding my name next time.)</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>After the halfway point we were in Queens where I saw so many friends cheering either at the Mile 14 water station, in the streets, or at the mile 15 Queens Center for Progress cheering station. And then, it got lonely and painful. I started the slow and long trek up the Queensboro bridge and about a fourth of the way up, I was starting to get really tired, and this was with me slowing down. My heart rate just spiked up and I was working way too hard. It was around this point that Marie tapped me on my elbow as she sped on in front of me. It was great seeing her there and hoping she‚Äôd have a good marathon.</p>

<p>I soon after regain composure when I made it to 1st Ave. where one of my coworkers was waiting for me but I didn‚Äôt hear him! Going up 1st Ave. was tough, especially when I felt I was going at a steady 6:30 pace but was actually closer to 6:50 pace. That 20 second pace difference is very noticeable at this point as you‚Äôre tired but want to keep pushing. Fine, not a big deal, just need to keep running and make it at least past the Bronx; if I get back to Manhattan on 5th Ave. in one piece I‚Äôll be happy.</p>

<p>I have a clear image of the first moment I stepped into the Bronx. During our training runs we run on the pedestrian side of the bridge and so we never get to run on the actual course. So as I stepped into the Bronx I now have this image of the first left corner and seeing a huge crowd waiting for us. The Bronx is mentally easily as I know all the turns very, very well‚Ä¶ and so I just tune off and run. But, as I was approaching the Western Beef and the final turns in the Bronx, I kept hearing my name. I knew that Elizabeth and Anthony (fellow teammates) were going to wait for us in the Bronx at mile 21 but it was not mile 21 yet. So I look around and I clearly see my grandma and my cousin Nayeli. I‚Äôm a bit confused and I turn around again and I see my other cousins, aunts, and uncles and I‚Äôm so surprised. This is the part that I can‚Äôt describe; I was surprised, in euphoria, and too emotional. I began to choke a bit as I felt a sob coming on but just had to put that aside and try to finish well&ndash;I didn‚Äôt want them cheering for me on a run which could have ended worse than it did.</p>

<p>With that, I did make it to Manhattan in one piece. It was running down 5th Ave. that further broke me down as I took a few walking breaks due to a mixture of fatigue and pain in my leg (not necessarily cramping since that came later around mile 24). Eventually, I made my way to the end right after waving at my family who were cheering for me on 59th St.</p>

It was a very tough marathon, especially coming off Chicago in early October, but my heart was all in it. So even though I didn&#39;t reach my goal, I still Boston Qualified and had the most fun I ever had in a marathon. I tried to focus more on everyone who was out there cheering and calling my name. It was even better knowing how many friends were tracking me #nopressure. And when I got to mile 20 in the Bronx I saw my family there! My abuelita, my aunts and uncles, and cousins. It was so unexpected that I choked up and got teary üò≠. And seeing my mom, aunt, and siblings near the end again was awesome. So a huge thank you to everyone! ‚ù§Ô∏è And a great sign by my sister @karennhaze. #likefatherlikeson #queensdistance #tcsnycmarathon #fam #love #marathoners #seeyousoonboston</a></p> <p style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;">A photo posted by Edwin (@algorhythm19) on <time style=" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;" datetime="2016-11-06T21:39:29+00:00">Nov 6, 2016 at 1:39pm PST</time></p></div></blockquote>

<h2>Closing the Year</h2>

<p>Pain. I finished the marathon cycle in a lot of pain. I have never felt that much pain in my legs after completing a marathon and I hope not to feel that again. I was trying to wait for my father but only managed to bump into Jose, Catherine, and Lori. The walk to get the poncho and exit Central Park was awful. I couldn‚Äôt move too fast and if I did it just made the pain worse.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/blog-images/2016-nyc-marathon.jpg" width="450" height="600" title="Reunited with my father after the NYC Marathon." alt="Reunited with my father after the NYC Marathon."></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve gotten up to this point and are wondering about the title, so am I. I had two great marathons which other runners would love to achieve, but I am personally not satisfied with the execution. As I mentioned before, they were great times but I faded after about 20 miles into both races. What I&rsquo;m truly getting at is that I&rsquo;m still trying to find myself as a runner. It sounds banal but I&rsquo;m just learning how competitive and how much more I want to achieve that I don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;ll stop, if at all.</p>

<p>Everyone learns something about themselves after running a marathon; you never really are the same after crossing the finish line. It wasn&rsquo;t so much this race but the whole experience that really changed me.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m overwhelmed and my heart is beginning to race as the plane prepares to take off. I then grin as I see my siblings' excited and nervous faces as we lift off; and with that we are off to Chicago! I went to Chicago for the marathon and came back with a new marathon personal best. Best of all, my teammates and siblings were there to enjoy the city of Chicago and our journey to another 26.2 mile race.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Another race, another personal best record broken. To be fair, I don&rsquo;t race too many 10Ks and the last one before the Scotland Run was in July of 2015. With all the training I&rsquo;ve done and my performances at the Washington Heights 5K and NYC Half, I expected good results. Of course, anything can happen during a race and this was race was no exception.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.nyrr.org/races-and-events/2016/scotland-run-10k">NYRR Scotland Run 10K</a> was the second club points race of the year and both our men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s competitive teams were already off to a great start. After the first club points race the men&rsquo;s team placed 8th in the A division, the women&rsquo;s team placed 4th in the B division, and both teams were hungry for more.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s 4:55 AM on a cold Sunday morning as I excitedly get ready for the NYRR United Airlines NYC Half. The prospect of having a great race made me nervous the whole morning and I couldn&rsquo;t keep my thoughts at bay. My father, who was about to tackle his first half marathon, and I get ready and leave, slowly running to the train station. As we exit the 59th St. station in Manhattan, the cold air sets a somber tone for the next few minutes until we meet other teammates. As we huddle together to stay warm we talk about our goals, how nervous we are, and how cold it is. It could&rsquo;ve been the pre-race jitters but I was shivering quite a lot, so much that I was afraid I might have been underprepared for this race.</p>

<p>As it turned out, after warming up for a bit and focusing on the race to come, everything calmed down. I sort of knew what I wanted to hit but I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I could it hit. This is not to say that I wasn&rsquo;t confident, but I did not feel like I was in the same shape I was back in October when I hit 1:20:25 for the Grete&rsquo;s Great Gallop half marathon. My goals consisted of first sub 1:21:00 and second sub 1:20:30, but Kevin (friend and coach) knew I could potentially hit sub 1:20:00 from the results of the workouts leading up to this race. It&rsquo;s also worth noting that I&rsquo;m focusing on 5K training and that I didn&rsquo;t really consider this race as a goal race. Weeks ago I wanted to use this race to evaluate where I am in my training and fitness, but it turned out so much better than that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My last personal blog post was written on March 7th, 2015. Over a year ago. I made an attempt to write more but that didn&rsquo;t happen, at least not for my personal blog.</p>

<p>That blog post mentioned how I had written one blog post, how I was in the middle of writing two more,  and how I was not too happy then.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a year and so much has changed. I have written <a href="http://www.nypl.org/blog/author/1269">seven blog posts</a> for nypl.org, two on running and five on coding; I have grown as a runner in 2015 and in the past three months of 2016; I ran the LA Marathon in February; I went to San Francisco last week to attend O'Reilly Fluent Conference; I just went on a date with my mom to see On Your Feet!; I have met so many other runners who motivate me; I&rsquo;ve helped my dad get on a running agenda and will race his first half marathon at the NYRR NYC Half and possibly run the Queens Marathon; and I am happy.</p>

<p>More biking, running, and coding.</p>
